# eden is ~~a rust library used for native java ffi~~ currently undergoing a rework!
Initially, eden was supposed to be a register-based JVM built in rust. Thinking back
on it, this was just limiting what a register-based cross-platform vm could truly do!

### Next Steps
When a good portion of the rootir library is finished, eden will be rebuilt from the 
ground up to convert classfiles and jarfiles into rootir files.
